        <div class="about me">
        <p>I'm an amalgamation of different talents & experiences that somehow found himself drawn to the world of Web Development. I have a degree in Fine Arts, majoring in Painting. So technically, I classify as a professional painter yet have never pursued the life. Over ten years of my professional career has been embedded in the HR side of technology companies/ businesses. I taught tech support at an American telecoms company, I’ve been a change manager for a Spanish IT solutions firm, and even now I hire tech leaders for executives at a Canadian insurance/ investment company. The biggest question really is why it took me so long to move over to the side of the businesses I supported.</p>

        <p>I’ve pursued my interests in fine arts more in my personal life. While I still paint, I spend more time sketching my ideas in the hopes of publishing my own comic one day. I am very well versed in all things pop culture, which is another way of declaring that I’m a big nerd. I attend comic conventions and usually put a lot of effort into the characters I cosplay. I’ve always been a fan of the Japanese pop culture, so much so that I used to travel there every year before moving to Canada.</p>
